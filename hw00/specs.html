	<h2>Algorithms Homework: General Specifications</h2>


	<p>These will apply to all homeworks unless specifically overridden for a given assignment (which I do not expect to
		do!).</p>
	<p>For every homework assignment, you will submit both a written and an implementation part. The written part will
		be submitted as a single&nbsp;<strong>pdf&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;txt</strong>&nbsp;document to the
		appropriate dropbox on MyCourses. The implementation part (consisting of several problems) will be submitted
		through the&nbsp;<em>try</em>&nbsp;system.</p>
	<p>For problems that ask only for a written answer, include your answer in your <strong>pdf/txt</strong> document
		(do not forget to state the problem number).</p>
	<p>Many problems will ask you to not only design an algorithm for a new problem but also to implement it. For each
		such problem you need to submit (unless stated otherwise in the homework statement):
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>in your pdf/txt document include:
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
				<li>a verbal description of your algorithm,</li>
				<li>a corresponding pseudocode,</li>
				<li>a sketch of the proof of correctness of your algorithm (i.e., an argument that your algorithm always
					produces the desired answer),</li>
				<li>a tight running time estimate for your algorithm, and</li>
				<li>a brief reasoning behind the running time estimate.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>
			submit the implementation of your algorithm through GRADESCOPE, following these instructions:
			<ol style="list-style-type: circle;">
				<li>Your programs must be written in Java or C++ or Python.</li>
				<li>You will submit a single file (this is recommended/preferred).
				</li>
				<li>Do not use any Java packages other than java.math, java.io and java.util.Scanner. In particular,
					note the absence of any data structures and algorithms from java.util in this list! Likewise for
					C++, you may use iostream and cmath but you may not use anything from the STL. </li>
				<li>You need to make sure that your code compiles on the
					CS machines.</li>
				<li>You will not be able to submit code that does not have the correct file name. </li>
				<li>All input will be from standard input and output to standard output, as described in each
					assignment. In particular, the input/output does not come from/go to a file! You must not provide
					any prompting or print anything else on standard output. Note that on most operating systems, you
					can redirect the contents of a file to appear on standard input, such as <tt>java MyProg <
							inputfile</tt>. This way you can test your code by including your input in a file and having
							it appear as if someone typed it on their keyboard</li>
				<li>Sample inputs and outputs will be provided, but these may not test all important cases - you should
					test your code using your own test cases!
				</li>
				<li>You do not have to check for the correctness of the input. It will always follow the described
					specification.</li>
				<li>Write your programs neatly - imagine yourself grading your program and see if it is easy to read and
					understand. Comment your programs reasonably: there is no need to comment lines like "i++" but do
					include brief comments describing the main purpose of a specific block of lines (e.g., "// merging
					two sorted arrays" if implementing the merge function in MergeSort).</li>
				<li>You may submit multiple times using GRADESCOPE. Only the final submission will be retained.</li>
			</ol>

		</li>

	</ul>

    <h4 align="center">Homework #0: Test the submission system</h4>
    <h4 align="center">Due: Monday 01/19/2026, 11:59 PM</h4>

    <!--
<p>
Note 1: This is the only homework that you submit <b>individually</b> - even if you work on it with a partner, every student needs to register their account with the try system and submit this homework under their own account name.
<p>

Note 2: this homework contributes 1% towards your final grade. 
Every student needs to register with the <tt>try</tt> system and submit 
their work.  Even if you are working with a partner, you both
must register and individually submit your work for this first
assignment.  (You can individually submit the same file.)

This homework is just to make sure everyone is comfortable with the 
process of submitting work via <tt>try</tt>.  (For future assignments,
it will only be necessary for one member of a partnership to 
submit via try.)
</p>

-->
    <p>
        Note : the aim of this homework is not to
        be challenging but to test and get familiar with
        the submission system. You will use this system for the duration
        of the semester.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note : for all assignments this term, it is your responsibility to
        comply with all homework <a href="specs.html">specifications</a>
        as set by your instructor.
        In particular, note that all inputs for all programs will come from
        <b>standard input</b>, not from a file, not as program
        arguments!
    </p>
    <!--
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>
First, you will need to log in to a Linux-based CS lab machine, either
locally or remotely (if remotely, ssh into glados.cs.rit.edu or any
lab machine).  Register in the grading database with the following
command, following all instructions carefully:
</p><p>
<tt>try tc-grd register /dev/null</tt>
</p><p>
You will only need to register once for the duration of the course.
If you accidentally register for the wrong section, please send
email to your instructor as soon as possible.
</p><p>
Finally, write some code to the following specification:
</p>
<h4>Problem 1</h4>
Input: A single nonnegative integer, n, not larger than 10,000.
Output: A list of all of the prime numbers less than or equal to n, in increasing order, each on its own line.

Submit your program with the following command:
<p>
<tt>try tc-grd hmwk0-1 Primes.java</tt>
</p><p>
or
</p><p>
<tt>try tc-grd hmwk0-3 primes.cpp</tt>
</p><p>
Test files:<a href="input-1.1">input_1</a>
<a href="answer-1.1">answer-1</a>
<a href="input-1.2">input_2</a>
<a href="answer-1.2">answer-2</a>
-->
    </p>
    <h4>Problem </h4>

    Input: The first line will contain a single positive integer, <em>n</em>, not larger than 10,000. Then, n more lines
    of input will follow, each containing a single integer (<em>a<sub>1</sub>...a<sub>n</sub></em>). You may assume that
    there are at least two different integers among <em>a<sub>1</sub>...a<sub>n</sub></em>.
    Output: The first line should output the smallest value among the a values. The second line should output the second
    smallest value (that is, the smallest value that is larger than the first value).

    Submit your program to gradescope with the following name:
    <p>
        <tt>SmallestTwo.java</tt>
    </p>
    <p>
        or
    </p>
    <p>
        <tt>smallesttwo.cpp</tt>
    </p>
    <p>
        or
        <tt>smallesttwo.py</tt>
    </p>
